# Fitness Tracker Application

The purpose of this application is to help people get fit and track their progress with simplified bodyweight circuit training that can be done at home. The world of exercise and fitness can be intimidating to newcomers and has many barriers to entry, like expensive equipment or overwhelmingly complicated routines. 

This application aims to solve this problem by encouraging people to try more focused circuit training consisting of just three exercises per routine. 

* Three basic routines are provided, using compound exercises selected to cover as broad a range of muscle groups as possible
* Users can add their own routines. 
* The only equipment required for the provided routines is a pull-up bar, which is cheap and readily available.
* Workouts are time-limited and users record the number of exercises they completed in the time limit.
* Users can clearly see their progress as their recorded number of sets for each routine will gradually increase as they master the exercises and improve their fitness.
